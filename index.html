            <h2>
                Traditional clothing
            </h2>

            <p>
                Men and women in India are draped and wrapped according to tradition, history and location.<br>
                A dhoti or lungi, which is a loose skirt- or shorts-type wrap for men, is common in rural areas and in high heat, 
                and most often it is worn alone, without a shirt.<br>
                In urban areas men often wear long, buttoned shirts and loose pants called Sherwanis or kurta pajamas. <br>
                Women throughout India wear traditional saris made of cotton, silk or 
                factory blends and the 5 to 7 yards (4.57 to 6.4 meters) of fabric that make up a sari are wrapped on the body in 
                countless ways depending on where the wearer lives.<br>
                Salwar kameez, a pant and long-tailed or to-the-knees shirt 
                outfit made of lightweight fabrics is most common for women in more urban areas.

                The National Anthem
            </h2>

            <p>
                "Jana Gana Mana" (lit.'Thou Art the Ruler of the Minds of All People') is the national anthem of the Republic of India. 
                It was originally composed as Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata in Bengali by polymath Rabindranath Tagore.
